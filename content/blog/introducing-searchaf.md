We're thrilled to announce the launch of **SearchAF**, a next-generation product search and discovery platform that brings the power of AI-driven semantic search to e-commerce.

## The Problem with Traditional Search

E-commerce search has been broken for too long. Traditional keyword-based search engines:

- **Miss the intent**: Users searching for "shoes for running" won't find products tagged as "athletic footwear"
- **Require exact matches**: Typos and variations lead to zero results
- **Ignore context**: Can't understand that "laptop bag" and "computer case" are related
- **Scale poorly**: As catalogs grow, relevance suffers

## The SearchAF Solution

SearchAF leverages **AntflyDB**, our cutting-edge vector database, to deliver semantic search that truly understands what users are looking for.

### Key Features

**🔍 Semantic Understanding**
Our AI models understand the meaning behind queries, not just keywords. "Footwear for jogging" will find running shoes, even if those exact words aren't in your product descriptions.

**⚡ Lightning Fast**
Built on AntflyDB's distributed architecture, SearchAF delivers sub-millisecond query performance, even with millions of products.

**🔐 Enterprise Ready**
Complete with OAuth integration, role-based access control, comprehensive audit logging, and SOC 2 compliance.

**🛠️ Developer Friendly**
RESTful API, comprehensive SDKs, and detailed documentation make integration a breeze.

## How It Works

SearchAF uses a hybrid approach combining:

1. **Vector Embeddings**: Convert product data into high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning
2. **Similarity Search**: Find products with similar meaning, even if words don't match exactly
3. **Traditional Keyword Matching**: Still works great for exact brand names and SKUs
4. **Smart Ranking**: Combines signals from both approaches for optimal relevance
