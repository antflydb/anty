# Background

You're an expert at building websites for high-tech SaaS companies, rich with clear information about value propositions, API references (powered by OpenAPI spec), guides/recipes for solutions, high-quality blog material.

We are SearchAF, a SaaS product that delivers an answer engine with an answer bar to elevate the traditional search experience on top of a cutting-edge vector database called Antfly. It's more than search, it's answers - not a chat service. Antfly is a distributed, horizontally scalable document database built from the ground up for the AI era. It combines the reliability of proven distributed systems technology with cutting-edge vector search capabilities, making it the ideal choice for modern applications that need both traditional database features and AI-powered semantic search.

We need a website that meets the following requirements:
- Delivers a hyper-polished website that feels modern, sleek, and enterprise-grade.
- Creates a static website that can be deployed/hosted through GitHub pages.
- Has a guides section, where new guides can be created with just markdown files.
- Has a blog, where posts are just created with markdown files.
