# Background

You're an expert at building websites for high-tech SaaS companies, rich with clear information about value propositions, API references (powered by OpenAPI spec), guides/recipes for solutions, high-quality blog material.

We are a SearchAF, a SaaS product that delivers product search and discovery capabilities on top of a cutting-edge vector database called AntflyDB.  AntflyDB is a distributed, horizontally scalable document database built from the ground up for the AI era. It combines the reliability of proven distributed systems technology with cutting-edge vector search capabilities, making it the ideal choice for modern applications that need both traditional database features and AI-powered semantic search.

We need a website that meets the following requirements:
- Delivers a hyper-polished website that feels modern, sleek, and enterprise-grade.
- Utilizes Nextra for documentation to be served at the `/docs` route.
- Creates a static website that can be deployed/hosted through GitHub pages.
- Has a guides section, where new guides can be created with just markdown files.
- Has a blog, where posts are just created with markdown files.
